This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python for two players. The game features a 3x3 grid where players take turns entering their moves by selecting positions numbered 1 to 9. It includes input validation to prevent invalid or duplicate moves, and it automatically checks for a win or draw after each turn. The board updates in real-time after every move, and the game ends when one player wins by aligning three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all positions are filled, resulting in a draw. No external libraries are required to run the game.
